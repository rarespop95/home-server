You need to add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
#VM
PUID=
PGID=

# IMMICH
IMMICH_VERSION=
IMMICH_DB_PASSWORD=
IMMICH_DB_USERNAME=
IMMICH_DB_DATABASE_NAME=

# Timezone
TZ=
```

## Secure the ADMIN_TOKEN for Vaultwarden

Previously the ADMIN_TOKEN could only be in a plain text format.
You can now hash the ADMIN_TOKEN using Argon2 by generating a PHC string.
This can be generated by using a built-in hash command within Vaultwarden, or use the argon2 CLI tool.

```bash
# Via docker and creating a temporary container
docker run --rm -it vaultwarden/server /vaultwarden hash
```

Add your password when prompted, and it will output a PHC string that you can use in your `.env` file.

```bash
# Via argon2 CLI tool
Generate an Argon2id PHC string using the 'bitwarden' preset:

Password:
Confirm Password:

ADMIN_TOKEN='$argon2id$v=...'
```

**Add the generated VAULTWARDEN_ADMIN_TOKEN to your `.env` file. Ensure the value is wrapped in single quotes.**

Check the [documentation](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/wiki/Enabling-admin-page#using-vaultwarden-hash) for more details on how to use the ADMIN_TOKEN in your Vaultwarden setup.
